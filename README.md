## 📌 Project Title
Naija-Language-ID: AI Model for Nigerian Local Language Detection

---

## 📖 Description
This project is an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** designed to detect Nigeria’s three major local languages (**Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba**) from short audio clips.  

The workflow covers:  
- Data collection (YouTube, podcasts, radio, interviews)  
- Audio preprocessing (resampling, slicing, speech detection with Silero VAD)  
- Feature extraction and deep learning model training (PyTorch)  
- Deployment of a demo application for real-time inference  

The goal is to build a robust **speech classification system** that supports Nigeria’s diverse linguistic landscape and has applications in **customer service, fintech, telecom, and language technology**.
